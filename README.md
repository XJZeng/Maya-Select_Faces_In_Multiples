# Maya-Select_Faces_In_Multiples
Selects faces in multiples for strips 

# Instructions for use: 
1). Paste the script into a python tab in the script editor. 

2). Select the start face. Start face is where you want the selection to start from.  
    If the geometry is not a closed loop, starting in the middle will probably only select one side of the faces. 
    
3). Enter the number you wish to select in multiples of. Eg. Every alternate will be 2, every third is 3, etc. 

4). Run script. 

*Note that this version won't work well with a full surface. One would have to seperate the surface into strips first.
